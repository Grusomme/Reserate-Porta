Web application for sending control messages to a background server

Django 1.11
Django REST framework 3.6.2

Django is a toolbox for creating a website engine (ish)

I used Vagrant and VirtualBox to create a virtual machine with Xenial64 that runs
the web server.

Vagrant mirror the project files on your local machine to the virtual machine, so any
changes made to your local files will also happen instantly on the vm, no reboot required.
